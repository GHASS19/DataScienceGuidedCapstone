Context of Problem:
Big Mountain Resort recently installed a new chairlift. The chairlift increased their operating costs by $1,540,000 for the season. The resort's pricing strategy has been to charge a premium above the average price of resorts in its market segment. Big Mountain is probably not capitalizing on its facilities to its potential.Their current ticket price compared to the market average does not provide how important different facilities are to their guests. Their ticket price is undervalued. This hinders their business investment strategy.
Criteria for Success:
Implementing a data-driven business strategy to create more revenue. Selecting the best possible value for their ticket price with data and information based upon other resorts in the United States that they compete with. Find ways to cut costs without reducing the ticket price. Or creating new facilities to justify a higher ticket price will create new success for Big Mountain.
Scope of Success:
Utilizing an algorithm in python based upon other ski resortâ€™s data and facilities in the United States to find the best possible ticket price that fits their market segment. This will also help them locate what facilities they need to add or remove to produce better revenue.

Key Data Sources:
-skiResort.csv  

Recommendations:
-I recommend that Big Mountain Resort increase their weekend price to $95.87 from $81.00. 
-I would do an experiment for a certain amount of time and close just one ski run on the weekend to reduce maintenance cost.
 	-Adding a run, 150 vertical feet and a new chairlift, (fast quad) is what I highly suggest the resort enact.
       This plan justifies a ticket price increase of $1.99 that improves revenue to $3,474,638 per year.
-Creating more space to ski and a new chairlift will prove why it is the most expensive ticket in Montana.
-Big Mountain needs to invest in facilities that guests value the most on their ski trips.
-The resort needs data on maintenance cost to make a solid decision going forward.

Key Findings
-Big Mountain offers more facilities and skiable terrain than most other resorts in the United States.
- In both of our models vertical drop, snow making, total chairs, fast quads, runs, longest run, trams and skiable terrain were   the most important to guests.  
-The resort is in the top portion of fast quads, runs, snow making, total chairs and vertical drop compared to other places.
-Most other resorts like Big Sky do not have a tram.
